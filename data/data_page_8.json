Being able to create persuasive ads can make a huge positive impact on your brand or company, so it is important to know how. Effective copywriting that sells is a skill acquired overtime, not overnight. However, following these tips given is a good start in the right direction to becoming an efficient copywriter. ",
          "So, what exactly is an ad copy? Well put simply, it is a headline, a body, and a call to action that form an ad. Ad copies are used for branding in the marketing world, and can significantly boost sales if done correctly. Ad copywriters are in charge of highlighting fundamental components of a product and try to market it to their customers in a way that draws their attention. ",
          "Having a powerful headline is crucial in an effective copy, as this is what customers first see. As a copywriter, one must do extensive research on the topic you are writing for, and really get to know your product. One must also make sure you know about everything relevant to your topic/product, in order to make sure everything flows smoothly, and you can efficiently write a good copy that sells.",
          "In order to create a good copy, it is very important to:",
          "This will ultimately help you write a better copy overall. A great marketing strategy that can positively influence your copy, is making sure you are speaking to the reader, and making sure you are describing what the product or service can do for them. ",
          "The reader is more interested in what the product or service can do for them, rather than reading about the product or service in general. This is a key component to making sure you are writing a good copy that sells.",
          "It is important to be very specific about your product and know all the details about your product. On your sales page, make sure to include specific features about your product in order to help you sell. Moreover, customer testimonials are also a great tool one should include when writing a copy that sells. ",
          "Reviews and testimonials are great sources when trying to sell, as people feel more confident in buying a product when others can testify that it is worthy of buying. Obtaining a clear idea of the value of this product is extremely necessary when writing a copy that sells, as you also need to have an idea of how much you should sell it for.",
          "Moreover, one should also use engaging language, in order to engage the reader and get them interested in the text. Using language that generates emotion with your customer is important, therefore one should try their best to target a specific audience and know what captures their attention and emotions. “Studies that have been conducted show that emotions caused by ads usually include happiness, trust, anticipation, and gratification,” according to the article, Harvard Professor Says 95% of Purchasing Decisions Are Subconscious.” In addition, the text should be concise, not too lengthy, or wordy, which can perhaps bore the reader. Keeping it simple and short while maintaining an approachable tone is important. Making it easy to read to keep their attention is recommended. Make sure your reader finds the ad copy interesting, entertaining, and useful. Lastly, end your sales copy with a purpose, making sure it motivates the customer to buy the product. Overall, this is the end goal, so you want to make sure your sales copy is effective enough to encourage your customer to further explore your business.",

          "Currently, the rapid evolution of the Internet of Things (IoT) has become very popular due to the need of its consumers to be in places where they cannot be physically present. The IoT is equipped with sensors, software, and other technologies that allow your devices to have the possibility of capturing the data that they will be able to see, hear, or perceive.",
          "The internet of things encompasses any thing or object that can be connected to an internet network, taking into account that this can range from factory equipment and internal transportation to mobile devices and smartwatches, so any object that we can imagine could be connected to the Internet and interact without the need for human intervention, recognizing that its main goal is machine-to-machine interaction and assisting industries to grow and develop to stay on track.",
          "On the other hand, IoT has become mainly all the applications it provides to improve and facilitate the daily lives of consumers, especially in business environments, as previously mentioned, but without neglecting the possibility of connecting everyday objects, such as household appliances, cars, thermostats, and baby monitors, to the internet through integrated devices, allowing us to have seamless communication between people, processes, and things. So we use these technologies extensively on a daily basis without having the technical knowledge that the technological devices we use are part of the IoT family.",
          "As a consequence of the recognition of the internet of things, we must not leave aside technologies such as sensors, connectivity that facilitate connection, and cloud computing and artificial intelligence (AI) platforms that offer us the possibility of a life with many facilities and greater challenges in the future."

          "First of all: What the heck is Canva?",
          "It is a not-so-new tool but has been growing gradually after the pandemic due to its easy access and free version. Launched in 2013, Canva is an online design and publishing tool with a mission to empower everyone in the world to design anything and publish anywhere.",
          "Canva operates an online design platform and media licensing service that empowers members, artists, designers, and photographers to design and collaborate, providing ready-made media and content that is licensable for use following various licenses.",
          "Is it free?",
          "The digital ecosystem of the platform was initially based on having a graphic resource to develop attractive presentations in an agile and easy way through predetermined templates; nowadays, they offer a wide range that goes from templates for social media, videos, and printables.",
          "The free version limits us with the number of templates and space to have its cloud, basically up to 5 GB. It is not that it falls short with this, but if you are looking to make designs characterized by their uniqueness, we will not obtain that added value for our projects with this option.",
          "The pro version presents us with two quite logical options; one in which after a 30-day free trial, they would charge you $199.99 for one year of the service using the application or the platform through the web for up to 5 people, with more than 600,000 templates and millions of stock photos with a storage limit of up to 100 GB.",
          "As a last option, among the most attractive: total control of what your team uploads to the platform as well as access to the application of each one of them, graphics, color, etc.; unlimited storage and 24/7 enterprise-level support. Sure, this magic for as little as $30.00 per month.",
          "Is it helpful?",
          "Today's world is advancing by leaps and bounds; the use of Canva as a graphic resource on a day-to-day basis or even in a planned project is a beneficial tool due to its simple nature and its free version, which can support a short term project. However, it is not the most versatile on the market.",
          "Canva is not a portable designer.",
          "Many discussions about the cold war between designers and this type of platform usually draw a critical panorama for the guild as if they were feeling replaced by machines, in the best style of \"the matrix.\"",
          "In my opinion, a designer must always have an open mind to the advancement of technology and its variables and adapt to them by expanding knowledge, leaving the comfort zone, and exploring perspectives that can always serve as a personal and professional future.",
          "Saying that Canva is against designers is wrong and counterproductive since the platform provides more than half a million templates and assets designed by professionals in the field.",
          "Even though the platform gives you the resources, it couldn't replace the job of a graphic designer in a company or project since there is a preparation and exploration of content also the gift of creativity that is applied in each of these moments in which it is necessary to call a designer.",
          "Alternatives to put out the fire",
          "Just like a fire extinguisher, Canva can be used in an emergency to provide support at certain times that require the use of graphic and creative applications. Still, we also have other options that can be the same or more recursive. that this platform",

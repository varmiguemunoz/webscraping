          "With technology taking over today’s times, digital marketing is the new desirable marketing method. With tons of digital marketing strategies to choose from, it is essential to stay up to date with the best marketing trends and techniques, especially if you have a company with a brand or product you are trying to sell.",
          "Digital marketing is any type of marketing that utilizes some sort of electronic device in order to advertise or promote a product or message. It usually appears on a computer, tablet, or phone, and even extends to television, although this is sometimes still considered traditional marketing. In previous times, marketing such as magazines and billboards took over the marketing industry, however, the internet has allowed us to use many different platforms and methods of marketing to get a message across to a wide variety of people and large audiences.",
          "Search engine marketing, social media, search engine optimization, and keywords, are all methods that the internet has allowed us to use in order to get a message across to as many people as possible. These methods allow for a bigger flow of traffic and visibility to your website or advertisement, and as a very large amount of people around the world use the internet on a daily basis, it is important to utilize these digital marketing strategies.",
          "Pay-per-click marketing for example is a form of digital marketing in which instead of paying a set amount of money to constantly run ads online, it allows you to only pay when someone clicks on your digital advertisement. Through the use of popular search engines such as Google, companies use google ads when using pay-per-click advertising. The better quality your advertisement is, the more relevant keywords it has, and the better the landing page quality, the more likely your ad is to be placed at the top of the search engine results.",
          "Another digital marketing method you should consider keeping in mind is affiliate marketing. Affiliate marketing is a type of marketing that allows others to gain income by promoting someone else’s business. ",
          "It is using a promoter to advertise your business, and giving someone commission when someone purchases an item from the promoter. Through the use of digital platforms that connect both the affiliate and the merchant, you can make your product appealing to promoters who can help you sell your product. Another great form of digital marketing is known as Influencer Marketing. ",
          "This form of marketing is similar to affiliate marketing, as it uses someone else to promote your products or services. Influencer marketing works with someone who may be well known, have a large platform or following, and can endorse your product. When using this form of marketing, it is important to make sure the influencer you are using is someone you want related to your business. ",
          "As they are essentially promoting your brand, they represent your brand, and if not chosen wisely, they can sometimes hurt your brand more than favor it. In addition, Native Marketing is another form of paid digital advertising, and it advertises discretely by trying to blend in with its surrounding content.",
          "Native ads label their advertisements with words such as “sponsored” or “promoted,” and they aim to match the content of the media source they are being promoted on. For example, an ad on Youtube may perhaps advertise something that is related to the content someone is searching for, and may appear in recommended videos. Lastly we will discuss marketing automation, which uses software to handle routine marketing tasks without the need for human action, and instead does things automatically. Marketing automation can handle marketing tasks without the need of a sales team, and this is what makes it so efficient. This allows for employees to be freed of certain tasks, and can also reduce human error while maximizing efficiency. Digital marketing has facilitated marketing in many aspects, and can target audiences effectively through multiple marketing strategies. This is why it is crucial for marketers to be up to date with all the multiple forms of digital marketing, to improve their methods of marketing and reach as many people as possible.",

          "When trying to write a good and successful copy, there are many factors to consider. Paying attention to content length, including a call to action, being persuasive, and more, are all important when trying to write a successful copy. However, the ultimate purpose and intent of your copy should be to get yourself noticed as much as possible, as a popular phrase once said, “any publicity is good publicity.” This is where SEO comes in handy, and can help your copy reach that next step. So, what exactly is SEO, and what does it stand for? SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization, and it’s basically a technique that can help your website rank higher in the search engine results pages. SEO helps increase the visibility of your website or product, in order to get more people to view your product and perhaps more people interested in buying your product or service. Search engines such as Google, Bing, and Yahoo, utilize bots that specialize in collecting information that can help you find exactly what you are looking for when searching for something online.",
          "Keyword research is vital in Search Engine Optimization, as the use of keywords helps with ranking higher in search engines in order to increase the flow of traffic to your website. So, you might be wondering what are keywords exactly, and how they relate to Search Engine Optimization. Keyword optimization is specific words that are analyzed and selected to target and help drive the qualified audience you are looking for from search engines to your website. Target keywords are extremely important, as choosing the correct keywords plays a huge role in your internet marketing, and are words that sum up everything on your website, including images, copy, video, etc. There are four main categories in which keywords can be summed up, which are commercial keywords, transactional keywords, informational keywords, and navigational keywords. Informational keywords are keywords used when searchers look for an answer to a specific question or general information. Navigational keywords are keywords used when searchers intend to find a specific site or page. Commercial keywords are keywords used when searchers look to investigate brands or services. And lastly, transactional keywords are keywords used when searchers intend to complete an action or purchase. More importantly, choosing the keywords your customers are looking for will help drive them to your website.",
          "There are plenty of keyword optimization tools and resources that can aid and guide you in searching for the most popular keywords, that are also the least competitive.

          "With 2022 coming to an end, many of us are looking forward to the new year and a fresh start. We are closing chapters and starting new beginnings while looking for ways to improve ourselves, hence the saying “New year, New Me.” Luckily, technology is a great aid in self-improvement and is something many of us already use on a daily basis. We can incorporate technology into many aspects of our lives in order to achieve new year goals such as fitness goals, financial goals, mindfulness goals, and many more. These goals are goals a grand majority of us set and strive to achieve when coming into a new year, however, studies have shown that not many of us actually achieve these goals once the year has come to an end. Why you may be asking? Well, because these goals aren’t specific, rather they are goals that can be considered far-reaching.",
          "If you are like the vast majority of the population, one of your New Years' resolution goals is perhaps to lose weight. First and foremost, this goal is more attainable if you set a specific goal weight you hope to achieve. For example, think of a specific number you’d like to reach, and then make your plan to execute it. Your weight goal number should be specific, and this will aid you much more in your weight loss journey. Once you have committed to a number, you can then look for apps that can help you achieve your goals. Think of a number of daily walking steps and aim to reach that number every day. Plan and cook more meals at home and plan how many meals you can eat out per week. Set limits with alcohol and cigarettes if you drink or smoke, such as only drinking and smoking on the weekends, and work towards those goals. Tons of devices can help you count your daily step count such as an apple or Xiaomi watch, and many apps available on the app store which allow access to influencers in the fitness industry with tons of workouts and food recipes, all from the convenience of your very own phone.",
          "Moreover, now that we have stated that to reach our fitness goals we must be specific in creating these goals, financial goals are something that many of us also struggle with and strive for when thinking of our New Years’ Resolutions. First and foremost, we should define our financial goals before anything. Set measurable, clear goals, and specific time frames to help keep you on track. Write down your goals, such as “I want to save for my retirement plan,” and install a savings app on your phone that can help you plan how much you can save per month. Try to track how much you are spending, and use banking apps that can help you track your spending habits. These applications allow you to separate your spending habits into categories such as utilities, rent, groceries, grooming, and more. There are tons of apps and resources available to help guide you into the new year, and help you reach all those New Year Resolutions goals with technology.",

          "Personal growth and development are vital in order to reach your desired goals. There are many ways to become the best version of yourself, however, it is a gradual process that does not happen overnight. Everyone’s personal growth and development processes look different, as we all have different values and long for various things, however, there are methods we can all use in order to try to help us accomplish those desired goals. Strategizing yourself and organizing specific, small, and attainable goals first is crucial in order to execute a big overall goal. It helps to visualize your exact goal, write it down, and manifest it as much as possible. This is why vision boards are popular and many would say effective, because they allow you to have a clear direction on what you want to achieve. Visualizing is the first step before manifesting, and should be done in a strategic manner.",
          "Establishing a clear set of goals is fundamental when trying to reach personal growth and development, however, there’s much more one can do in the process. Becoming emotionally intelligent is also something to take highly into consideration, as being able to understand your feelings and emotions can also greatly help you improve and grow on a personal level. Having control and a thorough understanding of one’s thoughts and emotions, and being able to act accordingly in certain situations is essential, and can really help you in your personal growth processes. In order to acquire emotional intelligence, one can read literature, begin journaling, seek a guidance counselor or life coach, examine how one reacts in stressful situations, and take responsibility for your actions. Acquiring emotional intelligence is a lifelong process that one must try to work on every day to see gradual progress.",
          "Another aspect one may take into consideration when trying to grow and develop personally is acquiring social skills. Being able to communicate and engage with others is also a fundamental skill that can help you get further ahead in life. Learning how to communicate with others, having confidence, and the ability to socialize in different social settings with different people is vital. In addition, learning a new skill can also aid in your personal growth and development process, as learning new skills comes with learning new knowledge. By acquiring new skills, you are opening yourself up to new opportunities and possibilities. Lastly, physical health is also something to highly consider when working towards personal goals and development. When one is physically active and healthy, this can aid you mentally and emotionally, make you feel and look better, therefore giving you more confidence as well. A healthy body cultivates a healthy mind, so nutrition, sleep, exercise, and meditation are all things to work on when working toward your personal wellness and development goals.",

          "Technology has facilitated many aspects of our daily lives and continues to do so through its daily advancements. Many apps have been made with the purpose of helping organize and structure our routines, plan ahead, and schedule our events. One of the best apps we have incorporated into our daily lives here at Parrolabs is ClickUp, an app that allows you to manage all your tasks in the most efficient way possible. With its To-Do list option, In Progress, and Completed, this app helps coordinate and arrange all your assignments in an organized manner. In addition, it has a calendar view, where you can see daily tasks, weekly tasks, and monthly tasks. Clickup also helps break down tasks into detailed checklists, and goal checklists, that you can check off once completed. Collaborate with other team members and coworkers, where you can all see what tasks are designated to whom, and when they are due. Moreover, you can set reminders, set specific due dates, add thorough details and descriptions, attach files from the internet, and even work in offline mode when you don’t have access to the internet.",
          "Another great app that has facilitated working remotely here at Parrolabs is Slack, which allows businesses to work together as a unified team. This app is a game-changer if you are looking to communicate with your team in a fast and organized fashion, without the need to email or call one another. This app allows you to attach files, video call, and makes communication a breeze for everyone. It also gives you the option to have multiple group messages, so you can organize your team messages in an easy manner. For example, you can have one channel for your entire team and all of your coworkers, and you can have a separate channel with only a few of your colleagues. This is a great option to keep information and tasks organized.",
          "By opening up a Gmail account, you can have access to many amazing tools such as these. Not only are they free, but, they also come with other cool features such as your own customizable email, which allows you to incorporate your company name in the email, it also comes with data storage “in the cloud,” which means your documents are always available anywhere you can get online with a web browser. With Google Drive, you can easily store your files in a secure manner and you can edit them from any device using Google Drive. Google Drive can also protect your files from suspicious activity and against malware, making it a very efficient app to use, especially within your company. Like the other few apps previously mentioned, this app allows for teamwork and collaboration with all of your employees, colleagues, and even your customers. These apps have made working with one another in the workplace much easier, organized, and have helped facilitate collaboration within your team.",
